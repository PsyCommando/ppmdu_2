--Random Uninteresting Fact--:
------------------------------
The weird name is inspired from my EoS playthrough, where I cheated to get a Poochyena as starter. 
He turned out really good after ingesting so many gummies and pretty much carried the team 
most of the game! XD
And, I just love that pokemon, so yeah, that's pretty much it..
